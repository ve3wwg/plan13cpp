The BASIC program and info was obtained from the following site:

    https://www.amsat.org/articles/g3ruh/111.html
    (C)1990 J.R. Miller G3RUH

Plan10 and then Plan13 was developed by James Miller G3RUH, from
OSCAR-10 position Calculation Program, Oscar News, 1983 Dec, No.45
p.15-18.

The C++ code was downloaded from:

    https://github.com/BackupGGCode/qrptracker.git

I couldn't determine who transcribed it to Arduino (C++). I have
modified it to be more C++/Linux friendly, removing the Arduino
references.

There was no license file found at the above githup repo.

My own changes are public domain.
